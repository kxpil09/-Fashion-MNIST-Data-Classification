# -Fashion-MNIST-Data-Classification
This is a project that uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset to classify different types of clothing. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of clothing items, each labeled with its corresponding class.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify these images into their respective classes.

#Dataset

The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, with each pixel having a value between 0 and 255. The images are labeled with integers ranging from 0 to 9, each corresponding to a specific class of clothing:

1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10.Ankle boot

# Requirements
This project requires Python 3.7 or higher and the following libraries:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. tensorflow

## These libraries can be installed using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow




# Usage
The project consists of a single Jupyter notebook Internship_Project_2_Fashion_MNIST_Data_Classification.ipynb, which can be run on Google Colab.

To run the project, open the Jupyter notebook Internship_Project_2_Fashion_MNIST_Data_Classification.ipynb on Google Colab and follow the instructions provided in the notebook.

# Results
The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set, which is a good performance for this task.
